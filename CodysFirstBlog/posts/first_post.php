<p>First post!  I built this blog engine around one basic concept: PHP doesn't need a template language because it <i>is</i> a template language.  This server can't talk to the outside world and nobody but me can upload files, so there's no risk in just using include().</p>
<p>Stick around for a while and comment as much as you want; all thoughts are welcome!</p>
